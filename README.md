## About
 I created this application to practice NodeJS and ExpressJS development. This application also makes use of MongoDB.
 
 The main concepts practiced in this app were:
 
 1. How to create an Express.js server
 2. Middleware
 3. Routing in Express.js
 4. The MVC design pattern
 5. Server side rendering
 6. Separation of concerns
 7. RESTful API convention
 8. MongoDB
 9. CRUD operations

 ## Run locally 
 
 In order to run this app locally, make sure you clone this repository in your local machine. Instructions to [clone a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Once you cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and download the dependencies (all the packages listed in the package.json file necessary for the app to run) by running: `npm install`.

 Once you have cloned the repository, make sure to install project dependencies by navigating to the project folder, and running
 
 `npm install`
 
 Now you are ready to run the application by running `npm run deploy` this will run both the client and the server concurrently.
 
 The terminal will tell you that the server is listening at port 8000. If you navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser, you should be able to see the user interface, where you're going to be received by the home page.
 There, you will see a form to submit a launch to explore more habitable planets.

 you can also look at other two pages displaying the upcomming launches and the history of successful and canceled launches.
